        What is Wikipedia Lite?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Wikipedia Lite is a simplified version of Wikipedia that allows you to just view the summary of your search
        result. While it may not go in depth into your search, it can separate the summary from the rest of the bloated
        excess that you might not need.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that it is a part of Wikipedia, there will always be the original page to get more details about your
        search.
