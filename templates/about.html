        What is Wikipedia Lite?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Wikipedia Lite is a simplified version of Wikipedia that allows you to just view the summary of your result
        page. While it may not go in depth into your search, it thrives in its simplicity to just give you the basics of
        what you are searching for.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that it is a part of Wikipedia, there will always be the original page to get more details about your
        search.
